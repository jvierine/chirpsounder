Quick start

Find interesting transmitters (and timings) here, eg., using this site:
http://websdr.ewi.utwente.nl:8901/chirps/

Calculate great circle distance between transmitter and you using, eg.,:
http://www.daftlogic.com/projects-google-maps-distance-calculator.htm

edit chirp_config.py and add the sounders that you are interested in,
and select rmin and rmax to reflect the ranges that you expect echoes
from (rmin should be about the great circle path, and rmax maybe 5000
to 15000 km more than that).

make sure that data_dir in chirp_config.py is readable for you. 

run chirp.py to accumulate data, and then run chirp_calc.py to analyze
results. 

If you get overflows, turn off adaptive filtering (whiten=False) in
chirp_config.py. If you still get overflows, reduce sample rate.
